# n_body_collision_raylib
Simulation of n particles of random masses, positions and velocities colliding elastically in 2D. Made with raylib.

This physics animation is created using the simple vector formulas for elastic collisions between 2 objects in 2D (see reference below).

How to build (on MacOS):

1. Open terminal
2. cd (to src directory)
3. make
4. ./n_body_collision_raylib
